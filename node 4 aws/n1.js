// loginin awa then type ec2 in search box then got to instances

// click on launch instances button on top right cornar to create new instance

// steps
// give name 
// select type of os use want to use
// select instance type (if you want to save money then select t2 micro and it is free for month)

// key pair login
// what would happen when i click on lauch instance button it will actually start new instance then server is started but i will have to do login to access it and somehow deploy my code there for that key pair are one easy way to do that. you can also create password for your machine and login, but keypairs more manageable thing to keep in mine, (keypair mean a pair of pubilc and private keys) 

// if you do not have key-pair -> click create new key pair btn to create it, give name, chose key pair type as rsa, private key file format as .pem and click on create key pair btn
// and that will download your key pairs
// do not share this any one otherwise they will have access to your machine
// each ec2 instance has there certain key pair
// once key is created select that key in key pair dropdown

// cloud provider
// aws  

//  but why do i need to use service provider why can not i deploy it on my local machine and use or access it everywhere (if i run it through localhost)  it it because of you do not have called the public ip address and that way we rant a aws server(or any server) which has two thing 1) you can acccess it from anywhere 2) and you will have public ip which i link to my domain and i will be able to access to my server how do i reach there through routers
